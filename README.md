Additionally, you have the option to receive timely notifications on your phone based on current indicator levels. Explore stock price movements with the intuitive Candlestick charts, enabling you to hover over specific days to gather vital data on high, low, and closing prices.

For a deeper understanding of market trends, you can graph prices of different stocks together and promptly access a correlation matrix for the stocks you've selected. In addition to these features, the app offers menu options to discover today's top gainers, losers, and most traded stocks, all of which can be conveniently sent to your phone via SMS.

Enhancing your analytical capabilities, the app allows you to evaluate various moving averages, including 50-day, 100-day, 150-day, and more. You can choose from six different types of moving averages, such as Simple, Exponential, Weighted, Kaufman's Adaptive, Triple Exponential, and Triangular.
