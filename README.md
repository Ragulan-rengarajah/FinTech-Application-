Our application is optimized for Canadian Stocks due to extensive data coverage, as Nasdaq's data for US stocks is limited and only goes up to October 29, 2021. When selecting your time period, we highly recommend entering "Present" to unlock the full functionality of our financial application.

Within the app, you can harness the power of comprehensive analysis tools. It not only graphs but also provides concise insights into a variety of momentum indicators, including RSI, MFI, ADX, and ADXR. Additionally, you have the option to receive timely notifications on your phone based on current indicator levels. Explore stock price movements with our intuitive Candlestick charts, enabling you to hover over specific days to gather vital data on high, low, and closing prices.

For a deeper understanding of market trends, you can graph prices of different stocks together and promptly access a correlation matrix for the stocks you've selected. In addition to these features, our app offers menu options to discover today's top gainers, losers, and most traded stocks, all of which can be conveniently sent to your phone via SMS.

Enhancing your analytical capabilities, our app allows you to evaluate various moving averages, including 50-day, 100-day, 150-day, and more. You can choose from six different types of moving averages, such as Simple, Exponential, Weighted, Kaufman's Adaptive, Triple Exponential, and Triangular.
